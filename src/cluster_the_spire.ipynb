    "These results align with expectations.  'AscendersBane' is the curse card which should be present in every winning deck with Defect on Ascension 20 and thus, it makes sense that it's the most frequent card (though I'm not quire sure how some games completed without it).  Below that are the starting cards 'Dualcast' and 'Zap', then the starting relic 'Cracked Core'.  The first non-starting resource is 'Coolheaded' and it appears in a full **81%** of games! I knew it was a good card, but it seems almost critical to success on Ascension 20 with Defect.\n",

We've created one (a view containing all relics and cards), but if I only wanted to select cards in the top 20th percentile, I can't because the relics are mixed in.  This being the case, we'll separate into cards and relics, then get the percentiles and ranks within those groupings.  \n",
