    "These results align with expectations.  'AscendersBane' is the curse card which should be present in every winning deck with Defect on Ascension 20 and thus, it makes sense that it's the most frequent card (though I'm not quire sure how some games completed without it).  Below that are the starting cards 'Dualcast' and 'Zap', then the starting relic 'Cracked Core'.  The first non-starting resource is 'Coolheaded' and it appears in a full **81%** of games! I knew it was a good card, but it seems almost critical to success on Ascension 20 with Defect.\n",
    "\n",
    "After having used this .csv when playing, it seems like it'd be more user-friendly to have a total of 3 .csvs per character.  We've created one (a view containing all relics and cards), but if I only wanted to select cards in the top 20th percentile, I can't because the relics are mixed in.  This being the case, we'll separate into cards and relics, then get the percentiles and ranks within those groupings.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we'll use a function to assign 'card' or 'relic' to `defect_resource_freq` in a 'resource_type' column, then subset on that before performing the ranking."

    "In the 'clustering_algorithm_methodology_testing' notebook, an unsupervised binary clustering algorithm was devised. Details about this method can be reviewed within that notebook, however, in this script, we'll simply be pulling in and applying the resulting functions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "That said, from a high level, the algorithm works as follows:\n",
    "1. Start with nodes equal to the number of games (k=m)\n",
    "2. Calculate the distance between each node and every other node where distance is the sum of resources that don't match (i.e. if a card is in both decks, that resource adds 0 distance, but it if is in one and not the other, then it adds 1 distance.  \"Distance\" is the sum of all these resource differences)\n",
    "3. For each node, calculate the nearest node(s) via distance + tolerance and add to the node via averaging. \n",
    "4. For each updated node, calculate the distances to all other nodes and the min and max distances per node\n",
    "5. Drop the node for which the min distance is the smallest and, of those, the max distance is the smallest (this steps adds maximum distance between the nodes)\n",
    "6. Repeat 2-5 until k=1\n",
    "7. Review average distances for k=1 through k=m\n",
    "8. Select a reasonable k"
