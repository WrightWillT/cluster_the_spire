    "These results align with expectations.  'AscendersBane' is the curse card which should be present in every winning deck with Defect on Ascension 20 and thus, it makes sense that it's the most frequent card (though I'm not quire sure how some games completed without it).  Below that are the starting cards 'Dualcast' and 'Zap', then the starting relic 'Cracked Core'.  The first non-starting resource is 'Coolheaded' and it appears in a full **81%** of games! I knew it was a good card, but it seems almost critical to success on Ascension 20 with Defect.\n",

We've created one (a view containing all relics and cards), but if I only wanted to select cards in the top 20th percentile, I can't because the relics are mixed in.  This being the case, we'll separate into cards and relics, then get the percentiles and ranks within those groupings.  \n",

Compared to the second medoid and the simulated games around it, we see values from 9 to 12. We see a difference of 8-13 for the third medoid cluster and 12-17 for the fourth medoid cluster. In all, it seems to be working as expected.\n",

As can be seen, the nearest of all the nodes (that isn't itself) is 1 and there are 7 nodes that have the same distance.  This means that 7 nodes have only a 1-resource difference to the first node. I'm not exactly sure how to handle ties, but it seems reasonable to simply take an average across all nodes that are equally close.  I can imagine a better (and more complex) strategy doing backtracking and seeing which node-pairing results in a smaller distance in the n+1 iteration and going with that, but I'll keep this version simple. \n",
