    "I've worked with several unsupervised clustering algorithms as part of my professional and academic career, but I had never built one from scratch.  Because the data for this project is binary and I had never worked exclusively with this type of data, I decided to test my creativity and see if I could build a functioning algorithmm from scratch with no outside influence.  \n",

    "After much whiteboarding, testing, and deep thought on the matter, I devised the following algorithm for clustering:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Clustering Algorithm**\n",
    "1. Start with clusters equal to the number of nodes (k=m)\n",
    "2. While k>=1:\n",
    "    1. Calculate the distance between each node and every other node where distance is the sum of resources that don't match (i.e. if a card is in both decks, that resource adds 0 distance, but it if is in one and not the other, then it adds 1 distance.  \"Distance\" is the sum of all these resource differences)\n",
    "    2. For each node, calculate the nearest node(s) via distance + a user-defined tolerance distance and merge with the node via taking the mean \n",
    "    3. For each merged node, calculate the distances to all other merged nodes and the min and max distances per merged node.\n",
    "    4. For each min and max distance, add a weighted user-defined tolerance distance percent where the weight is relative to k such that weight = k/m (this applies a 100% weight when k=m and decreases to 0% as k decreases. i.e. it takes larger 'steps' toward a lower k and slows down as k approaches 0)\n",
    "    5. Drop the node(s) for which the min distance is smaller than or equal to the min distance + tolerance and, of those, the max distance is the smaller than the max distance + tolerance (this steps adds maximum distance between the nodes)\n",
    "    6. Store the resulting centroids, k, and average distance between nodes\n",
    "    7. Set k equal to the resulting number of undropped nodes\n",
    "4. Review average distance for k=2 through k=m\n",
    "5. Select a reasonable k based on the average distance between nodes"

Compared to the second medoid and the simulated games around it, we see values from 9 to 12. We see a difference of 8-13 for the third medoid cluster and 12-17 for the fourth medoid cluster. In all, it seems to be working as expected.\n",

I'm not exactly sure how to handle ties, but it seems reasonable to simply take an average across all nodes that are equally close.  I can imagine a better (and more complex) strategy doing backtracking and seeing which node-pairing results in a smaller distance in the n+1 iteration and going with that, but I'll keep this version simple. \n",

This isn't surprising, but the elbow method of identifying the right number of clusters didn't exactly make choosing the right number of clusters obvious.  In fact, at k=4 clusters, we're seeing a minimum of the average distance between clusters.  This leads me to believe that I've misinterpreted the average_cluster_distance and I should, instead, be attempting to select the k for which the average_cluster_distance is small and the k+1 distance is a large jump."
